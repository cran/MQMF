\title{bce Baranov catch equation}
\usage{
bce(M, Fat, Nt, ages)
}
\arguments{
\item{M}{instantaneous rate of natural mortality, assumed constant}

\item{Fat}{a vector of age-specific instantaneous rates of fishing
mortality over the time period t, this is usually estimated by
multiplying the fully selected F by the selectivity/availability
at age.}

\item{Nt}{The population numbers-at-age at the start of time t}

\item{ages}{the ages 0:maxage used in the calculations}
}
\value{
a matrix of numbers-, natural mortality-, and catch-at-age
}
\description{
bce the Baranov Catch Equation. The total mortality of
    fish in an exploited population is made up of fish being killed 
    by fishing and others dying naturally. We use the bce to estimate 
    the catch (those killed by fishing). The problem is that some 
    fish that would be expected to die naturally can be expected to 
    be caught and killed by fishing so estimating the catch is 
    slightly more complex than numbers of fish available times the 
    harvest rate, Nt x Ht. It is invariably better to use the 
    Baranov Catch Equation when calculating the expected catches.

\examples{
age <- 0:25
Ft <- -log(1 - 0.2) # harvest rate of 0.2
Faa <- rep(Ft,length(age))
M <- 0.12
Nt <- 1000
bce(M,Fat=Faa,Nt,ages=age)   # should give 188.8862
